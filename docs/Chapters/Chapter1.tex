\section{Asteroid impact avoidance in the context of planetary defense}

The final law provided in Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design states that \textit{"Space is a completely unforgiving environment. If you screw up the engineering, somebody dies."} \cite{akinslaws}. This law was written for engineers designing and building crewed space systems, it highlights the facts that space is an extremely hostile environment towards humans. However, the issue at hand is that space is also hostile to humans even when they are on their own planet Earth. Of significant risk to planet Earth is a potential collision with a large asteroid or near-Earth object (NEO), which would cause massive tsunamis, multiple firestorms and potentially an impact winter caused by dust particles and debris rising to the stratosphere. All of this would ultimately lead to a mass extinction event, in which several species and life forms on our planet could not survive on the planet anymore. In fact, this has already happened once in the history of the Earth around 66 million years ago, when an object about 10 kilometers wide hit our planet in North America and triggered the \textit{Cretaceous-Paleogene} extinction event, which is the event that caused the extinction of most dinosaurs.
